=====Using Open Course Materials=====

====What are open course materials?====

Open Educational Resources (OER) are freely accessible, openly licensed documents and media that are useful for teaching, learning, educational, assessment and research purposes. Although some people consider the use of an open format to be an essential characteristic of OER, this is not a universally acknowledged requirement.
The development and promotion of open educational resources is often motivated by a desire to curb the commodification of knowledge and provide an alternate or enhanced educational paradigm. (Wikipedia)

====Where do I find quality open course materials?==== 

In general, you have to search multiple places. I've listed some below. However, please keep in mind that I have a good knowledge of this area and would be happy to help you. If you send me your syllabus, I'm happy to spend an hour or so seeing what I can dig up for use in your course. At the very least, I can give you some idea of what the situation in your specific course looks like and whether open materials are worth pursuing.

Over time I plan to [put together pages](?id=opencourseware-by-course) that talk about materials in some of our commonly offered courses.

A wide array of courses, and often your best bet for upper course coverage. However these materials are often very sparse: free powerpoints, but not free textbooks, free syllabi, but no free assessments.
